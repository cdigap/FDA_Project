Fundamentals of Data Analysis - Project 2018

# Problem statement
The box plot is common in data analysis for investigating individual numerical variables. In this project, you will investigate and explain box plots and their uses. The boxplot function from the Python package matplotlib.pyplot can be used to create box plots. 

# The Box Plot
In the Jupyter Notebook The_Box_Plot_Understanding.ipynb I have tried to explain what is Box plot, a brief history about the Box plot its origin, who first introduced the concept.

Explained various components of the Box plots like 

* The median,
* Two hinges, the upper and lower fourths (quartiles),
* The data values adjacent to the upper and lower fences, which lie 1.5 times the inter-fourth range from the median,
* Two whiskers that connect the hinges to the fences, and
(potential) out-liers, individual points further away from the median than the extremes.

I have used a Data set to explain the ways we can use the Box plot to understand the Data better and make informed decisions. 

Demonstrated the Box Plots Alternatives. So we can understand different patterns.

This Notebook will give a person an overview of what is Box plots and how we can use Python to create the same and demonstrate how we can make informed decisions.
